            <h1>Hi, I'm Abimael</h1>
            <p class="tagline">Speech and NLP engineer with a background in developmental psycholinguistics.</p>
        </header>

        <section class="about">
            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>I specialize in speech and language AI, with a particular focus on the messy, real-world scenarios where most systems break down: child speech, multi-speaker environments, and code-switching.</p>

            <p>My background combines three years of developmental psycholinguistics research at <strong>Penn</strong> (studying how children acquire language) with hands-on ML work at <strong>xAI</strong> and <strong>Meta</strong> (evaluating LLMs, ASR systems, and multimodal models). This gave me a rare perspective: I understand how human process speech <em>and</em> how to build systems that need to handle it.</p>
        
            <p>Recent work includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluating Grok 4's conversational capabilities and multimodal features at xAI</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning ECAPA-TDNN for child speech language identification at UW</li>
                <li>ASR quality evaluation and transcription pipeline work at xAI and Meta</li>
                <li>Placing 6th overall in the ACL Shared Task for biomedical summarization</li>
                <li>Building CNN-based automation for child gaze analysis</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm drawn to problems where linguistic theory meets engineering constraints where understanding <em>why</em> speech systems fail (phonetics, prosody, speaker variation) helps you build systems that actually work.</p>
        
            <p>Looking for roles in <strong>speech ML</strong>, <strong>conversational AI</strong>, or <strong>audio processing</strong> where I can work on the hard problems: real-world audio, low-resource languages, and systems that work for diverse speakers.</p>
