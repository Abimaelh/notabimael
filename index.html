    <h1>Hi, I'm Abimael!</h1>
    <p>I am a Computational Linguist with a background in Psychology and Language Science. I earned my B.A. from the University of California, Irvine, and later worked as the lab manager for 
        <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/">The Language Learning Lab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I led research on children's language acquisition, developed machine learning pipelines for linguistic analysis, and streamlined experimental workflows.  
        I am now pursuing an M.S. in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington, focusing on speech and language processing. My current research involves improving speech recognition for <a href="https://github.com/Abimaelh/child-lang-id">language identification in children's speech.</a>
